Components are coloured by tones. A colour is three inputs, `--tone`, `--tone-foreground` and `--tone-text`, set on `[data-slot][data-color="<name>"]`; core derives `--tone-soft`, `--tone-soft-foreground`, `--tone-border` and `--tone-border-subtle` from them and registers all seven as `tone-*` colours, so `bg-tone`, `text-tone-text` and the rest work as classes. The `--c-*` variables are gone: a rule that set `--c`, `--c-fg`, `--c-soft`, `--c-soft-fg` or `--c-edge` now sets `--tone`, `--tone-foreground` and `--tone-text`, and drops the rest. Button, Badge, Alert, Toggle, the choice controls and Toast read tones; Toast no longer exports `toastAccents`.
